# Personal Website - Ronak Dhingra

This repository contains my single page personal homepage project made in my first year (May 2022).
The aim of the project was to learn to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a personal website.

## Opening the Website

To open the website from the terminal, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Start a local web server. If you have Python installed, you can use the following command:

   - For Python 3.x, use:
     ```
     python -m http.server
     ```

4. You should see the following message on the terminal..

    `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...`

    ..or something similar.
    After starting the web server, open a web browser.
5. Enter the following URL in the address bar:
    `http://localhost:8000`
Replace `8000` with the appropriate port number if you specified a different one while starting the server.
6. The website should now open in your web browser, allowing you to explore its content.
